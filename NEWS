NEWS for the Gmisc package

Changes for 0.6.2.0

* Ran through som Pkg-check and hopefully cleared out some bugs

Changes for 0.5.7.0
-------------------
* getCrudeAndAdjusted is now an S3 method that has a default method and a method for rms objects. The rms relies on rms:::summaryrms and returns a matrix that is pruned and used for the situation.

* Added default_ref for both getDescriptionStatsBy and describeProp function. 
* The percentage sign in getDescriptionStatsBy, describProp and describeFactors is now optional.
* A minor bug fix for cgroup.just for the htmlTable function
 
Changes for 0.5.4.5
-------------------
* Minor fix to rownames in htmlTable... again.
* Had to remove the "terms" option from the plotHR rms:::cph() alternative as it did caused an error
** The error seems to stem from predictrms() where the Adjto function deletes the adjto output in:
** adjto <- if (int.pres) 
**        model.matrix(Terms.ns, adjto)[, -1, drop = FALSE]
** I will have to look into it one day...
