#' A package for plotting, tables, and basic outputs. 
#' 
#' This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in my research.
#' The package is inspired by Frank Harrel's Hmisc package. The main focus
#' is on tables and plots. 
#'  
#' For tables you'll find the convenient htmlTable that I have used 
#' for advanced table layout. A major focus has been to have
#' it compatible with LibreOffice (you can copy/past from there into word)
#' as I generally want to be able to send my documents to a 
#' journal in .doc/.docx format. 
#'  
#' The plots are forestplot2 and transitionPlot. The forestplot is a more
#' general version of the original \code{\link[rmeta]{forestplot}}() function
#' aimed at using the forestplot for more than just meta-analyses. 
#' 
#' The transition plot is for descriptive purposes in order to illustrate the
#' size of change between one state and the next. This is basically a 
#' graph of \code{table(var1, var2)}. It uses the \code{\link{bezierArrowSmpl}}
#' alternatives for showing off elegant arrows that should nicely bend into 
#' each box.
#' 
#' Additionally there is the \code{\link{getSvdMostInfluential}} function
#' that tries to illustrate and use the Svd in order to select the ones having
#' most influence on the V-matrix. 
#' 
#' Apart from those you will find a few handy functions for formatting 
#' p-values, generating the basic stats for your table 1, etc.
