\title{A package for plotting, tables, and basic outputs.}
\description{
This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in
my research. The package is inspired by Frank Harrel's
Hmisc package. The main focus is on tables and plots.

\details{
For tables you'll find the convenient
\code{\link{htmlTable}} that I have used for advanced table
layout. A major focus has been to have it compatible with
LibreOffice (you can copy/past from there into word) as I
generally want to be able to send my documents to a journal
in .doc/.docx format. \bold{Note:} it is now often possible
to copy->paste directly from the viewer into a MS Word
document without any layout loss.

To accompany the \code{\link{htmlTable}} function is the
\code{\link{getDescriptionStatsBy}} it is a straight
forward function that aims at helping you to generate
descriptive table stratified by different variables. In
other words, the function returns everything you need for
generating a \emph{Table 1} ready for publication.

The main plots are \code{\link{forestplot2}} and
\code{\link{transitionPlot}}. The forest plot is a more
general version of the original
\code{\link[rmeta]{forestplot}} function aimed at using the
forest plot for more than just meta-analyses.

The \code{\link{transitionPlot}} is for descriptive
purposes in order to illustrate the size of change between
one state and the next, i.e. a transition. This is
basically a graph of \code{table(var1, var2)}. It uses the
\code{\link{bezierArrowSmpl}} alternatives for showing off
elegant arrows that should nicely bend into each box.

Additionally there is the
\code{\link{getSvdMostInfluential}} function that tries to
illustrate and use the SVD in order to select the ones
having most influence on the V-matrix.
