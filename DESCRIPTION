Title: A few handy misc functions for plots, tables, and more
Author: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: This is a collection of functions for tables, plots, and more. For
    tables you'll find the convenient htmlTable() that I use for advanced
    markdown table layout. A major focus has been to have it compatible with
    LibreOffice and MS Word - you can now copy-paste most tables directly into
    your document from the viewer. The main plots in the package are the
    transitionPlot() and forestplot2(), see the examples for demo. Apart from
    those it is worth mentioning the getDescriptionStatsBy() and its associated
    function that help you generate a descriptive table (i.e. the Table 1 in
    most journals), the pvalueFormatter() that formats p-values, and
    mergeLists() that provides a complex recursive list merge.
